# r-placer
a stupid bot for r/place

## what
almost working r/place bot that takes an input image, location, and account logins to draw to the r/place canvas. relatively neat compared to [this one](https://github.com/Zequez/reddit-placebot) as coding style is more OOP. though, could still need some touching up
## contributing
